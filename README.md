# Radioactive Decay Simulator

A Monte Carlo simulation of radioactive decay using real isotope data.

## Features
- JSON isotope database
- Half-life based decay
- Monte Carlo + binomial sampling
- Plotting with matplotlib
- Comparison of plots - Monte Carlo vs Theory (results calculated by the equation)



## Usage
python3 radio.py

## Example
Simulates decay of U-238, Th-234, Pa-234 so far

## In the works: 
Hopefully I'll add a gui for printing out the element all periodic table-esque
I am currently working on the decay chains, so stay tuned for that (hopefully)
